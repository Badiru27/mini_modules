# squiry_mini_modules

This is a mini module of an application we are trying to build.

I am having issues with fixing bugs related to ShowTimePicker and ShowDatePicker. 

When trying to update an already created exam table, the controllers are not displaying the selected date and time. Please kindly help in reviewing 

Thanks
